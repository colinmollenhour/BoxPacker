Filling one container
=====================

``Packer::pack()`` assumes the whole consignment has to leave today: if it
will not fit in one carton, another is opened. That is the right default for
e-commerce fulfilment.

Sometimes the constraint is the other way around. The container is fixed, and
the warehouse has *more* cargo than will fit. You want this sailing, this
trailer, or this pallet as full as possible; whatever is left waits for the
next one. Typical cases:

* An ocean container or swap-body you have already paid for, loaded from a
  yard of outbound stock
* A store-replenishment pallet or roll-cage with a hard size limit
* A single van or trailer run, where a second trip is worse than leaving a
  few lines behind

``VolumePacker::packBestSubset()`` is for that situation. It still packs into
one box you supply. It is allowed to leave items out if that produces a
fuller load — for example skipping one bulky piece so several smaller ones
can take its place.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
        use DVDoug\BoxPacker\ItemList;
        use DVDoug\BoxPacker\Rotation;
        use DVDoug\BoxPacker\VolumePacker;
        use DVDoug\BoxPacker\Test\TestBox;  // use your own `Box` implementation
        use DVDoug\BoxPacker\Test\TestItem; // use your own `Item` implementation

        $container = new TestBox('40ft', 1203, 235, 269, 0, 1203, 235, 269, 26000000);
        $yard = new ItemList();
        $yard->insert(new TestItem('Pallet A', 120, 80, 100, 500000, Rotation::BestFit), 8);
        $yard->insert(new TestItem('Crate B', 60, 40, 40, 80000, Rotation::BestFit), 40);

        $loaded = (new VolumePacker($container, $yard))->packBestSubset();
        // $loaded->items went on this departure
        // anything not in that list stays in the yard

Use ``pack()`` when every item on the order must ship. Use
``packBestSubset()`` when the vehicle is the scarce thing.

.. warning::

    ``packBestSubset()`` does more work than ``pack()`` because it considers
    leaving items behind. Keep it for one container and a known pool of
    cargo, not as a substitute for packing a full day's orders.
